# Bayesian-A-B-testing
This Project aims to use Bayesian methods to draw conclusions whether the marketing ad will yield more returns than psa (Public service announcement) with probabilities and not using the old frequentist approach method.
Bayesian approach to A/B testing gives a probability insight in the sense that, it measures how well a product or feature is better than the other and not just relying on your intuition.
I also wrote an article explaining the methodology in detail [here](https://medium.com/@temitopeakinpelu98/bayesian-a-b-testing-for-website-conversion-rate-optimization-e4aeb5dbb1f9)
