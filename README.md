# Bayesian-A-B-testing
This Project aims to use Bayesian methods to draw conclusions whether the marketing ad will yield more returns than psa (Public service announcement) with probabilities and not using the old frequentist approach method.
Bayesian approach to A/B testing gives a probability insight in the sense that, it measures how well a product or feature is better than the other and not just relying on your intuition.
I also wrote an article explaining the methodology in detail [here](https://medium.com/@temitopeakinpelu98/bayesian-a-b-testing-for-website-conversion-rate-optimization-e4aeb5dbb1f9)

### Aims and objectives
The aim and objective of this project is to improve conversion rates using [marketing_AB.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahelederakhshande/marketing-ab) data and to optimize user experience and identifying whether the campaign will be successful or not by investigating which variant ads (treatment group) or psa (control group) is best.
